need to install conda environments before running, e.g.:
snakemake --snakefile Snakefile_fastq2bam --profile ./profiles/slurm --conda-create-envs-only

specify time as string in profiles/slurm/cluster_config.yml , e.g.:
"71:00:00"

Give BWA 20 threads instead of default 10.

If you want to modify time limit, which determines the queue/partition on Della, put these values in ./profiles/slurm/cluster_config.yml.
Put still put memory values in resources.yml in root dir, since these get loaded in and used in rules.
